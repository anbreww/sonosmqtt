# Sonos to MQTT bridge

Reads currently playing track on Sonos system and posts to relevant 
topic on MQTT

Will allow monitoring of specific topics for play/pause/skip actions

The aim is to provide a super simple bridge to allow ESP8266 based modules
to control the music in the house and display some "now playing" information
on little LCD screens
